# the PSEUDOCODE of the solution of this program is as follows:

# Open the datafile.txt
fileh = open("datafile.txt")

# Read the file contents into a string variable
data = fileh.read()

# Split the file into 'lines' for processing
lines = data.splitlines()

# Initialize a sum variable to 0

# Loop through each line in the collection of 'lines' retrieved from the file
    # if the line contains xmax
        # extract the number 
        # add the number to the sum

# print the sum
