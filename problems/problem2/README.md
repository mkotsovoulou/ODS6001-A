# Programming Exercise 2: Conditional Execution

Enhance programming exercise 1 to calculate the pay 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40. The code to prompt the user for input is already created for you...

Compute and display the amount to pay depending on the hours worked.

Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). 

Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program once more (the pay should be 498.75).


## Execute your program 

Use the following test data to make sure your program produces correct resutls.

### TEST 1:

Enter hours worked: 35

Enter rate per hour: 2.75

96.25

### TEST 2:

Enter hours worked: 45

Enter rate per hour: 10.50

498.75



Remember in order to execute your code you type in the terminal:
```
python3 problem2.py
```

If you want you can test your program with different inputs!

## Check Your Code

Execute the below to evaluate the correctness of your code using `check50`, but be sure to test it yourself before that...
Login with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

If you do not have generated a Personal Access ToKen follow the instructions: 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```
check50 mkotsovoulou/ods6001a/main/problems/problem2
```

Execute the below to evaluate the style of your code using `style50`.

```
style50 problem2.py
```

{% next %}

## Submit your code

Execute the command below, logging in with your `GitHub username` and `Personal Access Token` when prompted. For security, you'll see asterisks (`*`) instead of the actual characters in your token. 

```
